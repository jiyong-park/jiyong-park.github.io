## Research Interest
My research interests lie at the intersection of the business and social values of information systems and technology (IS/IT), focusing on three primary areas aligned with the triple bottom line of corporate sustainability (Planet, People, and Profit): (i) Green IS/IT, including green technological innovation, (ii) the societal impacts of IS/IT, such as the future of work, and (iii) IT value.
<p>Methodologically, my research leverages econometric techniques for causal inference and computational social science approaches to analyze a broad spectrum of business and social data.</p>
