## Research Interest
My research interests lie at the intersection between business and social values of information systems and technology (IS/IT), primarily in three research areas in keeping with the triple bottom line of corporate sustainability (Planet, People, and Profit): (i) Green IS/IT (including green technological innovation), (ii) Societal Impacts of IS/IT (including the future of work), and (iii) IT Value.
<p>Methodologically, my research employs econometric methodologies for causal inference as well as computational social science approaches to a range of business and social data.</p>
