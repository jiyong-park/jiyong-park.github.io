## Research Interest
My research interests lie at the intersection between business and social values of information systems and technology (IS/IT), primarily in three research areas along the three P’s of Sustainability (Planet, People, and Profit): (i) Green IS/IT & Green Technology, (ii) Societal Impacts of IS/IT, and (iii) IT Value.
<p>Methodologically, my research employs econometric methodologies for causal inference as well as computational social science approaches to a range of business and social data.</p>
