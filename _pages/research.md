## Research Interest
* My research interests lie at the intersection between economic value and societal impacts of information systems and technology. My research has been primarily oriented toward three areas:
	1. Societal Impacts of Information Technology and Machine Learning
	2. Automation, Productivity, and Future of Work
	3. Information Technology for Environmental Sustainability
