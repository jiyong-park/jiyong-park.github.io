## Research Interest
* As information technology has permeated all aspects of businesses and the broader society, I am interested in the role of information systems and technology as a primary means to the co-creation of profits, social and environmental benefits and the balance among them. My research interests especially lie at **the intersection between economic value and societal impacts of advanced technology**. My research has been primarily oriented toward three areas:
	1. Societal Impacts of Information Technology and Machine Learning
	2. Automation, Productivity, and Future of Work
	3. Information Technology for Environmental Sustainability
* Methodologically, I am well-trained in **Econometrics** (including randomized experiments, quasi-experiments, instrument variable approach), as well as **Data Analytics** (including machine learning, natural language processing). Recently, I am particularly interested in integrating applied econometrics, data analytics, and machine learning into a single framework.
