# Jiyong Park, Ph.D.


I am an Assistant Professor of Information Systems at the Bryan School of Business and Economics, University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG).

Digital technologies have permeated and influenced all levels of the society from individuals and organizations to communities and even the natural environment. My research interest is how information systems and technology contribute to the broader society and the natural environment as a primary means of the co-creation of economic values and social and environmental benefits. I am a firm believer in data, not because they speak the answer for itself, but because they help us explore better answers to the right questions.

> “Social scientific research is and always will be tentative and imperfect ... But by patiently searching for facts and patterns and calmly analyzing the economic, social, and political mechanisms that might explain them, it can inform democratic debate and focus attention on the right questions.” Quoted from Capital in the Twenty-First Century
