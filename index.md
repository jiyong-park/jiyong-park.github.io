# Jiyong Park, Ph.D. 


I am an Assistant Professor of Information Systems in the Bryan School of Business and Economics, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG).

Given that information technology has permeated all levels of society – individuals, organizations, communities, and nations, the role of information systems and technology as a primary means to the co-creation of profits, social and environmental benefits and the balance among them.

In the Introduction of his book entitled “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” economist Thomas Piketty states that
> “Social scientific research is and always will be tentative and imperfect ... But by patiently searching for facts and patterns and calmly analyzing the economic, social, and political mechanisms that might explain them, it can inform democratic debate and focus attention on the right questions.”

This is what I view as the role social scientists should play.
