I am an Assistant Professor of Management Information Systems at the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia.

Digital technologies have permeated and influenced all levels of society, from individuals and organizations to communities and even the natural environment. My research interests focus on the role of information systems and technologies in sustainable business, emphasizing their potential as a primary means for co-creating business value alongside social and environmental benefits.

> “Social scientific research is and always will be tentative and imperfect ... But by patiently searching for facts and patterns and calmly analyzing the economic, social, and political mechanisms that might explain them, it can inform democratic debate and focus attention on the right questions.” Quoted from Capital in the Twenty-First Century
