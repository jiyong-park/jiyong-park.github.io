# Jiyong Park, Ph.D.


I am an Assistant Professor of Information Systems at the Bryan School of Business and Economics, University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG).

Digital technologies have permeated and influenced all levels of the society from individuals and organizations to countries and the natural environment. In this regard, I am interested in how information systems and technology interact with the broader society and the natural environment as a primary means to the co-creation of economic values and social and environmental benefits, in pursuit of sustainable development.

In the Introduction of “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” the author states that
> “Social scientific research is and always will be tentative and imperfect ... But by patiently searching for facts and patterns and calmly analyzing the economic, social, and political mechanisms that might explain them, it can inform democratic debate and focus attention on the right questions.”

This is what I view as the role social scientists should play.
