## Jiyong Park \ KAIST College of Business
&nbsp;

I am a PhD Candidate at KAIST College of Business. Given that business and technology do not exist separately from the social ecology, I am interested in the role of information systems and technology for the sustainable society, beyond a driver of productivity growth and business value creation. My research interests especially lie at the intersection between economic and societal aspects of advanced technology.

Sustainable development consists of the “triple bottom line”—economic, environmental and social dimensions. In line with these dimensions, my research topics include as follows:
1. Societal Impacts of Information Technology and Machine Learning
2. Automation, Productivity, and Future of Work
3. Information Technology for Environmental Sustainability

I have presented my research at several leading academic conferences/workshps, including International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), Workshop on Information Systems and Economics (WISE), and the INFORMS Conference of Information Systems and Technology (CIST), among others.
