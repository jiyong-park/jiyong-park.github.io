I am a PhD Candidate at KAIST College of Business. As information technology has penetrated into all aspects of our society – individuals, organizations, society, and nations – business and technology are increasingly assimilated to the social eco-system. In this regard, I am interested in the role of information systems and technology for the sustainable society, beyond a driver of productivity growth and business value creation. 

Sustainable development consists of the “triple bottom line” — economic, environmental and social dimensions. My research interests especially lie at the intersection between economic and societal aspects of advanced technology. Specifically, my research topics include as follows:
1. Societal Impacts of Information Technology and Machine Learning
2. Automation, Productivity, and Future of Work
3. Information Technology for Environmental Sustainability

In the Introduction of his book entitled “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” economist Thomas Piketty states that
> “Social scientific research is and always will be tentative and imperfect.”

> “But by patiently searching for facts and patterns and calmly analyzing the economic, social, and political mechanisms that might explain them, it can inform democratic debate and focus attention on the right questions.”

This is what I view as the role social scientists should play.
