# Jiyong Park, Ph.D. 


I am an Assistant Professor of Information Systems in the Bryan School of Business and Economics, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG).

Given that information technology has permeated all levels of society – individuals, organizations, communities, and nations, I am interested in the role of information systems and technology as a primary means to reconciling economic and business value with social and environmental sustainability. 

Sustainable development consists of the “triple bottom line” — economic, environmental and social dimensions. My research interests especially lie at the intersection between economic and societal aspects of advanced technology. Specifically, my research topics include the following:
1. Societal Impacts of Information Technology and Machine Learning
2. Automation, Productivity, and Future of Work
3. Information Technology for Environmental Sustainability

In the Introduction of his book entitled “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” economist Thomas Piketty states that
> “Social scientific research is and always will be tentative and imperfect ... But by patiently searching for facts and patterns and calmly analyzing the economic, social, and political mechanisms that might explain them, it can inform democratic debate and focus attention on the right questions.”

This is what I view as the role social scientists should play.


Below are the global goals for sustainable development set by the United Nations.
