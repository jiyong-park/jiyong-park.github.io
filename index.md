I am a PhD Candidate at KAIST College of Business. Given that business and technology do not exist separately from the social ecology, I am interested in the role of information systems and technology for the sustainable society, beyond a driver of productivity growth and business value creation. My research interests especially lie at the intersection between economic and societal aspects of IT.

Sustainable development is defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” by the Brundtland Commission of the United Nations in 1987. Sustainable development consists of the “triple bottom line”—economic, environmental and social dimensions. In line with these dimensions, my research topics include as follows:
	1) Automation, Productivity, and Future of Work
	2) Societal Impact of Information Technology
	3) Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Information Technology
	4) Information Technology for Environmental Sustainability

I have presented my research at several leading academic conferences/workshps, including International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), Workshop on Information Systems and Economics (WISE), and the INFORMS Conference of Information Systems and Technology (CIST), among others.
